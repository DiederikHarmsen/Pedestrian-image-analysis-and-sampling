# Pedestrian-image-analysis-and-sampling
Was playing around with some images of pedestrians I had, used different datasets found, and wanted to check how variated the images were and wanted to get some samples 
from a large dataset. 

The brightness files check the colors in the images to analyze how bright they are. A really simple way of doing it.

The sampling files gets some samples of the images in folders and copies them to a destination folder.
